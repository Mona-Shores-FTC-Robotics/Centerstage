Things to do
1. Try the code on a different robot to see if the gyro drops out (identify if its a hardware//software issue
    definitely is a grounding wire of some sort. Just touching metal to metal causes the gyro to go to zero.
1.5  Does other robot need to be tuned with RR (at least check encoder directions)
    This needs to be done.
2. Did the update fix the jittering? (RUN WITH ENCODERS AFTER STOP AND RESET ENCODERS)
    setting power to zero, resetting encoders, and then resetting them back to run with encoders seems to have fixed this.
3. Fix the Gamepad issues to make it easy to use - can we consistently detect our alliance color/side of field/prop?
4. Does the auto driving work well? What tweaks do we need?
5. Does the localization work well? How can we make it better?
6. Is code ready to test the arm/end effector?
7. Is code ready to test the lift?
8. Have we tested Spike Only Auto?
9. Have we tested SpikeBackdropParkAuto
10. CAn we see telemetry in the dashboard? How can we improve our telemetry to the dashboard?
11. What about the 20 frames for detection code?
12. Tweak the manual driving controls
13. Tweak the automatic drive controls
